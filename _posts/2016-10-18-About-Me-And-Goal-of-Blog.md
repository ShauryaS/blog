<h2>Who am I?</h2>

Hello everyone. I will start of this blog post by talking about who I am. My name is Shaurya Srivastava and I am 16 years old. I attend Monta Vista High School in Cupertino, CA. I am currently in 11th grade, a junior as people call it, and turns out that this is one of the hardest years in my high school career. Outside of school, I do many things. I am a second degree black belt holder in Taekwondo. I have been in Taekwondo for about 9 years. Apart from training in Taekwondo classes, I also am an instructor. I am also a Boy Scout with the rank of Life. I am on my way to getting my eagle scout, which I hope to achieve within the next year. Through Boy Scouts, I love hiking, climbing, kayaking, and many more high adventure activities. I am part of an Organization called Rising International, an organization with a goal to help women in poor countries gain money, by selling their crafts, to support themselves and their children. I am a representative in this organization with a roll to help sell their crafts in the US. I also handle the Rising International snapchat account and handle the Technology for Rising. Outside of my main activities, I love coding for fun. I have coded projects for companies such as GlobalEdge Inc. and CFO-Online. I have also coded my own personal projects such as a Test Study Planner and Java Predation Simulator. The languages I code in are Swift, Java, C++, C#, Objective C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Apart from coding, I love solving problems and puzzles, especially the Rubikâ€™s Cube. I am obsessed with the Rubikâ€™s Cube. I can solve almost any Rubikâ€™s Cube there is. I am also obsessed with new tech devices. I read and watch videos to learn as much as I can about new Tech releases. I love watching sports, especially Football and Basketball. My favorite football team is the New England Patriots and my favorite basketball team is the Golden State Warriors. I enjoy reading books and watching movies. My favorite book series is the Harry Potter series and my favorite movie series is the Marvel superhero films. My goal for the future is to land a job in any Big Tech Company in the business management side.

<h2>Why does this blog exist and what is its future?</h2>

This blog exists so that I can spread my thoughts to people. Over the past couple years, I have had a lot of thoughts just building up in my mind and I wanted to have a place where I could write these thoughts down and share them with the world. I will mostly focus on writing my thoughts on but not limited to Technology, Business, Politics, and Sports. This is more of a casual blog than a formal blog. Feel free to comment and start a discussion on any one of my blog posts as I am also interested in knowing all of your views on the topic my Blog posts explore. My goal is to upload one blog post a month (if possible) on a topic that is relevant to the day itself. Hope you all enjoy reading my blog posts and contribute to discussions about the topics.
